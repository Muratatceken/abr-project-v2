## Training Configuration Analysis

- **Learning Rate**: 0.0001
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 100
- **Mixed Precision**: True
- **Optimizer**: adamw

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues

- **No training logs found for analysis**

## ðŸ”§ Immediate Fixes

- Add detailed loss component logging to monitor signal/peak/classification losses separately
- Implement proper F1 score calculation in validation loop
- Add classification report logging every few epochs

## ðŸ”§ Hyperparameter Tuning

- Try curriculum learning with gradual loss weight ramping
- Experiment with different optimizers (AdamW with different betas)
- Consider cosine annealing with warm restarts for learning rate

## ðŸ”§ Architectural Changes

- Add skip connections in classification head
- Implement multi-scale feature extraction
- Consider attention mechanisms for better feature selection

## ðŸ”§ Data Improvements

- Analyze class distribution and implement better balancing strategies
- Add more sophisticated data augmentation
- Consider synthetic data generation for minority classes

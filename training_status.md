# ABR CVAE Training Status

## âœ… Training Successfully Started

**Current Status:** Training is running in the background  
**Start Time:** ~06:16 AM  
**Duration:** ~34 minutes and counting  

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

### 1. NaN Loss Problem - RESOLVED âœ…
- **Problem:** All loss values were showing as `nan`
- **Root Cause:** NaN values in peak targets causing loss computation to fail
- **Solution:** 
  - Fixed peak loss function to handle NaN values properly
  - Added numerical stability checks in encoder
  - Data cleaning to remove NaN/Inf from raw data

### 2. DTW Library Warnings - RESOLVED âœ…
- **Problem:** Repetitive DTW library warnings cluttering output
- **Solution:** Modified to show warning only once at module import

### 3. Progress Bar Repetition - IMPROVED âœ…
- **Problem:** Too frequent progress updates
- **Solution:** Increased log interval from 50 to 200 batches

## ðŸ“Š Training Progress

**Checkpoints Created:**
- `best_model.pth` (19.2MB) - Current best model
- `checkpoint_epoch_0.pth` (19.2MB) - First epoch
- `checkpoint_epoch_10.pth` (19.2MB) - 10th epoch

**TensorBoard Logs:**
- Multiple event files showing training metrics
- Can be viewed with: `tensorboard --logdir checkpoints/`

**Expected Training Time:**
- 100 epochs total
- ~1138 batches per epoch
- Estimated completion: ~2-3 hours

## ðŸŽ¯ Training Configuration

- **Dataset:** 51,999 samples from 2,038 patients
- **Model:** CVAE with peak prediction
- **Latent Dimension:** 32
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Learning Rate:** 1e-3
- **Beta Annealing:** Linear warmup over 10 epochs
- **Peak Loss Weight:** 1.0

## ðŸ“ˆ Last Known Metrics

From the previous run before fixes:
- **Total Loss:** ~2.5 (stable, no more NaN)
- **Reconstruction Loss:** ~0.6 (good)
- **KL Loss:** ~27 (normal)
- **Peak Loss:** ~1.9 (working properly)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Monitor Progress:** Training will continue automatically
2. **Check Results:** Best model will be saved as `checkpoints/best_model.pth`
3. **Evaluate:** Can run evaluation mode after training completes
4. **Inference:** Can generate new samples using the trained model

## ðŸ’¡ How to Monitor

```bash
# Check if training is still running
ps aux | grep "python main.py"

# View TensorBoard logs
tensorboard --logdir checkpoints/

# Check latest checkpoints
ls -la checkpoints/
```

Training is progressing successfully! ðŸŽ‰

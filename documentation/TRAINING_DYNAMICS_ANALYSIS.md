# 🔍 TRAINING DYNAMICS ISSUE ANALYSIS

## 🚨 PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

### Current Training Pattern (PROBLEMATIC):
- **Epoch 0**: Loss 537,177 → ~80 (99.98% drop)
- **Epochs 1-7**: Loss ~80 → ~78 (minimal change)
- **Issue**: Massive initial drop followed by plateau

### ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:

#### 1. **Learning Rate Too High** 🔴
- **Current**: 2e-4 (too aggressive)
- **Effect**: Model "jumps" to local minimum in first epoch
- **Result**: Unable to fine-tune thereafter

#### 2. **Inadequate Learning Rate Scheduling** 🔴
- **Current**: Fixed LR throughout training
- **Problem**: No adaptation after initial convergence
- **Missing**: Progressive LR reduction

#### 3. **Loss Weight Imbalance Still Present** 🔴
- **Threshold Loss**: Still ~70 (dominates)
- **Other Components**: ~0.5-3
- **Effect**: Model focuses only on threshold, ignores fine-tuning

#### 4. **Batch Size vs Learning Dynamics** 🔴
- **Current**: 48 (may be too large for fine-tuning)
- **Effect**: Too coarse gradient estimates
- **Need**: Smaller batches for precise updates

#### 5. **Optimizer Configuration** 🔴
- **Current**: AdamW with standard settings
- **Missing**: Proper warmup and momentum tuning
- **Need**: More sophisticated optimization strategy

## 🛠️ SOLUTION STRATEGY

### 1. **Multi-Phase Training Approach**
- **Phase 1**: Controlled initial learning (LR: 1e-5)
- **Phase 2**: Aggressive learning (LR: 5e-5)  
- **Phase 3**: Fine-tuning (LR: 1e-6)

### 2. **Progressive Loss Weight Scheduling**
- Start with balanced weights
- Gradually adjust based on component convergence

### 3. **Adaptive Batch Size Strategy**
- Start with larger batches (stability)
- Reduce for fine-tuning (precision)

### 4. **Sophisticated LR Scheduling**
- Warmup phase
- Cosine annealing with restarts
- Plateau detection and reduction

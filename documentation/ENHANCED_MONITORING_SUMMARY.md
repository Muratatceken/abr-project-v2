# 📊 Enhanced ABR Training Pipeline Monitoring

## 🎯 **Overview**

The ABR training pipeline has been significantly enhanced with comprehensive monitoring capabilities to track all loss components in your multi-task learning setup. This addresses the issue where only total loss was visible during training.

## 🔍 **What Was Enhanced**

### **1. Progress Bar Monitoring**
**Before:**
```
Epoch 1/200: 19%|████▉| 215/1140 [37:38<2:24:26, Loss=75.8041, LR=1.00e-04]
```

**After:**
```
Epoch 1/200: 19%|████▉| 215/1140 [37:38<2:24:26, Total=138.007 | LR=1.00e-04 | Signal=1.030 | Class=1.944 | Peak=0.831 | Thresh=130.453]
```

### **2. Detailed Step Logging (Every 50 Steps)**
```
Step 100 - Total: 138.0073, Signal: 1.0295, Class: 1.9444, Peak: 0.8308, PeakLat: 2.8213, PeakAmp: 1.3438, Thresh: 130.4529
```

### **3. Comprehensive Epoch Summaries**
```
Epoch 1/200 Summary:
  Train - Total: 138.0073, Signal: 1.0295, Class: 1.9444, Peak: 0.8308, Thresh: 130.4529
  Val   - Total: 124.2066, Signal: 0.9266, Class: 1.7499, Peak: 0.7478, Thresh: 117.4076
  LR: 1.00e-04
```

### **4. Enhanced TensorBoard Visualization**
- **Individual loss curves** for each component
- **Grouped loss breakdown** visualization
- **Learning rate tracking**
- **Validation vs Training** comparisons

### **5. W&B Integration**
- **Detailed metrics** with proper grouping
- **Loss breakdown** sections
- **Real-time monitoring** capabilities

## 📈 **Loss Components Tracked**

| Component | Description | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Total** | Combined weighted loss | Overall training progress |
| **Signal** | Signal reconstruction loss | Diffusion quality |
| **Class** | Classification loss | Hearing loss type prediction |
| **Peak** | Peak existence loss | Peak detection accuracy |
| **PeakLat** | Peak latency loss | Peak timing accuracy |
| **PeakAmp** | Peak amplitude loss | Peak magnitude accuracy |
| **Thresh** | Threshold loss | Hearing threshold prediction |

## ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

### **Logging Frequency**
Control how often detailed loss breakdowns are logged:

```yaml
training:
  log_frequency: 50  # Log detailed metrics every N steps
```

### **TensorBoard Integration**
Enable/disable TensorBoard logging:

```yaml
logging:
  use_tensorboard: true
  log_dir: logs
```

### **W&B Integration**
Enable/disable Weights & Biases:

```yaml
logging:
  use_wandb: false  # Set to true to enable
  wandb:
    project: "abr-hierarchical-unet"
    tags: ["diffusion", "abr", "s4", "transformer"]
```

## 🎮 **Usage Examples**

### **1. Standard Training with Enhanced Monitoring**
```bash
python train.py --config configs/config.yaml --experiment enhanced_monitoring
```

### **2. High-Frequency Monitoring (Every 10 Steps)**
```bash
python train.py --config configs/config.yaml --experiment detailed_monitoring --log_level INFO
```
*Note: Set `log_frequency: 10` in config for more frequent updates*

### **3. TensorBoard Monitoring**
```bash
# Start training
python train.py --config configs/config.yaml --experiment tb_monitoring

# In another terminal - start TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir logs/tb_monitoring
```

### **4. Test Monitoring Features**
```bash
python test_enhanced_monitoring.py
```

## 📊 **Monitoring Best Practices**

### **1. Loss Interpretation**
- **High Signal Loss**: Poor diffusion reconstruction
- **High Classification Loss**: Poor hearing loss type prediction
- **High Peak Losses**: Poor peak detection/timing
- **High Threshold Loss**: Poor hearing threshold estimation

### **2. Balanced Training**
Monitor that no single loss component dominates:
- All losses should decrease over time
- Loss ratios should remain relatively stable
- Sudden spikes indicate training instability

### **3. Multi-Task Convergence**
Look for:
- **Coordinated decrease** across all loss components
- **Validation losses** tracking training losses
- **Stable learning rate** scheduling

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| One loss dominates | Single component >> others | Adjust loss weights in config |
| Validation diverges | Val loss >> Train loss | Reduce learning rate, add regularization |
| Unstable training | Erratic loss patterns | Enable gradient clipping |
| Memory issues | OOM errors | Reduce batch size, enable mixed precision |

### **Loss Weight Tuning**
If monitoring shows imbalanced losses, adjust weights:

```yaml
loss:
  weights:
    diffusion: 1.0      # Signal reconstruction
    peak_exist: 0.5     # Peak existence
    peak_latency: 1.0   # Peak timing
    peak_amplitude: 1.0 # Peak magnitude
    classification: 1.0 # Hearing loss type
    threshold: 0.8      # Hearing threshold
```

## 🎯 **Expected Training Patterns**

### **Healthy Training Progression**
```
Epoch 1:  Total: 150.0, Signal: 2.0, Class: 2.5, Peak: 1.2, Thresh: 140.0
Epoch 10: Total: 75.0,  Signal: 1.0, Class: 1.8, Peak: 0.8, Thresh: 70.0
Epoch 50: Total: 35.0,  Signal: 0.5, Class: 1.2, Peak: 0.4, Thresh: 32.0
```

### **Warning Signs**
- **Stagnant losses**: No improvement over multiple epochs
- **Diverging validation**: Val loss increasing while train decreases
- **NaN values**: Gradient explosion or learning rate too high
- **One task failing**: One loss component not decreasing

## 🚀 **Advanced Monitoring Features**

### **1. Custom Metrics**
Add your own metrics to the monitoring:

```python
# In trainer.py, extend _update_metrics method
def _update_metrics(self, metrics, loss_components, batch):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Add custom metrics
    metrics.custom_metric = calculate_custom_metric(outputs, targets)
```

### **2. Real-time Plotting**
Use TensorBoard for real-time visualization:
- Loss curves
- Learning rate schedules
- Gradient norms
- Model histograms

### **3. Alert Systems**
Set up alerts for training issues:
- Loss spikes
- Gradient explosions
- Convergence stalls
